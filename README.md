### Comparison of gene expression levels in the left and right sides of the developing mouse heart

Repository accompanying the paper *Molecular characterization of Left-Right symmetry breaking in the mouse embryo*, by Tyser et al. 2023. [DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.26.521947](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.26.521947)

#### Data
This study reanalyses data from *Tyser, Ibarra-Soria et al., Science, 2021* ([DOI: 10.1126/science.abb2986.](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2986))

#### Exploring the dataset
The original dataset can be explored dynamically at https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/heartAtlas. 

- An additional tab [*Left-right gene expression*] has been added, to plot the expression of any gene in the *left* and *right* cells separately.
